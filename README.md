# Introduction

StackSync (<http://stacksync.com>) is a scalable open source Personal Cloud
that implements the basic components to create a synchronization tool.


# Architecture

In general terms, StackSync can be divided into three main blocks: clients
(desktop and mobile), synchronization service (SyncService) and storage
service (Swift, Amazon S3, FTP...). An overview of the architecture
with the main components and their interaction is shown in the following image.

</p>

The StackSync client and the SyncService interact through the communication
middleware called ObjectMQ. The sync service interacts with the metadata
database. The StackSync client directly interacts with the storage back-end
to upload and download files.

As storage back-end we are using OpenStack Swift, an open source cloud storage
software where you can store and retrieve lots of data in virtual containers.
It's based on the Cloud Files offering from Rackspace. But it is also possible
to use other storage back-ends, such as a FTP server or S3.
